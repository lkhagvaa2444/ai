# MNIST Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Implementation

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Overview

The project consists of the following files:

- `conv_layer.py`: Contains the implementation of the ConvLayer class for defining convolutional layers.
- `mnist.py`: Main script for training and testing the CNN on the MNIST dataset.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run the scripts, you need:

- Python 3.x
- Dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`

You can install the dependencies using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone <repository-url>
cd mnist-cnn
```

2. Train the model:

```
python mnist.py train
```

3. Test the trained model:

```
python mnist.py test
```

### Project Structure

- `data/`: Directory to store MNIST dataset (downloaded automatically if not present).
- `models/`: Directory to save trained model checkpoints.
- `results/`: Directory to save training results and evaluation metrics.
