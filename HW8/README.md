CartPole Problem Solution Using Fixed Strategy
Description:
This repository contains a Python script (cartpole_fixed_strategy.py) that demonstrates a basic strategy to solve the CartPole problem using a fixed policy without employing machine learning techniques.

Requirements:
Python 3.x
OpenAI Gym
Instructions:
Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the cartpole_fixed_strategy.py script.
Observe the performance of the fixed strategy in keeping the pole upright.
Results:
The fixed strategy successfully keeps the pole upright for a certain duration before termination.
Performance may vary depending on the specific implementation of the fixed strategy.
