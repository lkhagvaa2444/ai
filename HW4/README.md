# Backpropagation Gradients Calculation

This Python script computes the gradients of the output with respect to each input for a simple neural network structure using backpropagation.

## Neural Network Structure
- Inputs:
  - x
  - y
  - z
- Intermediate Calculation:
  - g = x * y
- Output Calculation:
  - f = g * z

## Usage
- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Run the script.
- The gradients with respect to x, y, and z will be printed.

## Example Result
- Given x = 2, y = 3, and z = 4:
  - Gradient with respect to x: 12
  - Gradient with respect to y: 8
  - Gradient with respect to z: 6
